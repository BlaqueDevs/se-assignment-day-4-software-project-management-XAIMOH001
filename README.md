# SE_DAY4_Software-Project-Management
## 1. Why is timely delivery crucial in software project management, and how can project managers ensure that deadlines are met?

Define project scope, milestones and deadlines early.
Assign tasks based on team member's profession.
Identify potential risks and create mitigation plans.
Use project tracking tools like gantt charts or Agile boards.
Maintain open communication among stackholders and your team members.

## 2. How does effective cost control contribute to the success of a software project? 

It ensures that the project stays within budget, preventing financial strains and ensuring porofitability this prvents projects from running out of funds before completion.

What strategies can be used to prevent budget overruns?
  Accurate cost estimation.
  Budjet tracking.
  scope management.
  Efficient resource utilization.
  Risk management.

## 3. Compare and contrast Agile and Waterfall methodologies. What are the main advantages and disadvantages of each?

Advantages of agile.
  Flexible.
  Allows continuous feedback.
  Quick iterations.
  Suited for evolving requirements.
  
Disadvantages of agile.
  Requires high collaboration.
  Difficult to document changes.
  Can lead to scope creep.
  
Advantages of Waterfall method.
  Well-structured.
  Easy to manage.
  Clear documentation.
  Good for projects with fixed requirements.
  
Disadvantages of Waterfall.
  Its rigid.
  Difficult to accommodate changes.
  Testing occurs late in the cycle.

## 4. In what types of projects might Agile be more beneficial than Waterfall, and vice versa? Can you provide examples of each?

Agile
  Better for dynamic projects.
  example: web and mobile applications.
           A startup developing a new e-commerce platform with evolving features.
              
Waterfalls
  Better for well-defined, large-scale projects with fixed requirements.
  example: bankingsystems, goverment systems.
             A payroll management for a government policy.

## 5. What are some methods for ensuring quality assurance throughout a software project?

Methods for ensuring quality asssurance.

  Peer reviews to detect errors early.
  Running tests to catch bugs before deployment.
  Regular code updates and testing.
  Ensuring the software meets user expectations.

 Why is it important to maintain high standards?
  Maintaining high standards prevents defects.
  Enhances user experience.
  Improves software reliability.
  Ultimately leading to higher customer satisfaction and lower maintenance costs.

## 6. How does defining the project scope contribute to successful project planning? What is a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), and why is it useful?

  Defining project scope helps set clear objectives, avoid scope creep, and ensure all stakeholders agree on deliverables. 
  It provides a roadmap for development.

Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) is a hierarchical decomposition of tasks that breaks a project into smaller, manageable components.

  Helps in resource allocation and time estimation.
  Provides clarity on task dependencies.
  Facilitates better project tracking and management.

## 7. What are the benefits of developing a detailed project schedule, and how can Gantt charts assist in this process?

Benefits of a detailed project schedule:

1. Ensures tasks are completed on time.
2. Helps in resource allocation.
3. Allows better risk management

How Gantt charts help:

1. Visually represent tasks and timelines.
2. Show task dependencies and overlaps.
3. Help in monitoring progress and identifying delays.

## 8. What are the core issues that your software aims to address? 

  Difficulty in finding buyers or sellers within campus.
  Lack of a centralized platform for students to trade items.
  High dependency on word-of-mouth marketing.

Why are these problems significant to your target audience?

  Saves time and effort for students looking for products.
  Provides a secure marketplace within the university.
  Reduces waste by enabling second-hand item sales.
